    "     - Combine the previous two steps into a new [LINEAR->ACTIVATION] forward function.\n",
    "     - Stack the [LINEAR->RELU] forward function L-1 time (for layers 1 through L-1) and add a [LINEAR->SIGMOID] at the end (for the final layer $L$). This gives you a new L_model_forward function.\n",
    "- Compute the loss.\n",
    "- Implement the backward propagation module (denoted in red in the figure below).\n",
    "    - Complete the LINEAR part of a layer's backward propagation step.\n",

    "**Note** that for every forward function, there is a corresponding backward function. That is why at every step of your forward module you will be storing some values in a cache. The cached values are useful for computing gradients. In the backpropagation module you will then use the cache to calculate the gradients. This assignment will show you exactly how to carry out each of these steps. "

    "\n",
    "Now you will implement the backward function for the whole network. Recall that when you implemented the `L_model_forward` function, at each iteration, you stored a cache which contains (X,W,b, and z). In the back propagation module, you will use those variables to compute the gradients. Therefore, in the `L_model_backward` function, you will iterate through all the hidden layers backward, starting from layer $L$. On each step, you will use the cached values for layer $l$ to backpropagate through layer $l$. Figure 5 below shows the backward pass. \n",

    "$A^{[L]} = \\sigma(Z^{[L]})$. Your code thus needs to compute `dAL` $= \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial A^{[L]}}$.\n",
    "To do so, use this formula (derived using calculus which you don't need in-depth knowledge of):\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can then use this post-activation gradient `dAL` to keep going backward. As seen in Figure 5, you can now feed in `dAL` into the LINEAR->SIGMOID backward function you implemented (which will use the cached values stored by the L_model_forward function). After that, you will have to use a `for` loop to iterate through all the other layers using the LINEAR->RELU backward function. You should store each dA, dW, and db in the grads dictionary. To do so, use this formula : \n",
